# Dashboard-for-PhDs-awarded-in-the-US

Data Source: [https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19301/data](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19301/data)

I made a dashboard visualization of a few interesting aspects of the doctorate recipients data using `plotly`. 

## Questions to answer:
- What is the trend in the number of doctorates awarded in the United States over time?
- Over time, what are the trends in the number of doctorates awarded in the United States in different major fields?
- Over time, what are the distribution of the postgraduation plans?
